<h1>Chinook 3-tier PHP</h1>
<p>This assignment was to test our abilities within the PHP language, as well as the 3-tier structure.</p>
<p>To use this application, you'll have to either use the 'Chinook' MySQL scripts to generate your own database, or use the SQLite database.</p>
<p>Slight modifications were made to the included SQLite database to represent which datasource was being used. In this case, the first listed track name in Track has SQLite appended to the end.</p>
